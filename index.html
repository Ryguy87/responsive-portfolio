        <p class="pcontent">Hello to anyone out there reading this! Unfortunately for me, this assignment requires an “about me” section. Talking
            or even writing about myself is something I don’t consider myself to be good at. I’m naturally shy, an introvert
            I guess. I have always been that way since I can remember. If I had to describe myself in one word I would say
            geek.
        </p>

        <p class="pcontent">I am always trying to learn new things. I really don’t watch anything on tv or on the internet unless it has something
            I can learn from it. So, if I watch anything then it is either documentaries on history, science, wildlife, biology,
            and technology. Or videos on how to do something/make something.
        </p>

        <p class="pcontent">I also like pc gaming. I’m into a few competitive games such as Dota 2 it’s called a MOBA and it was originally made
            as a mod from Warcraft 3. I also like RPGs like the Witcher series. I love strategy games anything with military
            strategy.
        </p>

        <p class="pcontent">
            Well that’s pretty much all I have to say about myself, so take care!
